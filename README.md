<h1>Payroll Calculator</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project is a comprehensive payroll calculator that computes both bi-weekly and annual wages. The script gathers essential employee details—such as name, employee ID, hours worked, hourly wage, and union membership status—and calculates:

  - Regular and overtime wages (with overtime computed at 1.5× the hourly rate for hours exceeding 40).
  - A range of deductions including union fees, retirement contributions, state and federal taxes (using specified tax brackets and rates), Social Security, and Medicaid.
  - Final net pay, presented in detailed bi-weekly and annual summaries.

The tool is designed to provide a clear breakdown of gross income, deductions, and net earnings, making it a practical solution for payroll management and financial planning.
